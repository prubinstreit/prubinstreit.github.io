Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their
analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on
experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and
statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for
Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the
Political Science Department's Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student
Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international
relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program
where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social
sciences. I am also a
[certified instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/#jayrobwilliams) with
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which develops evidence-based
methods for teaching "essential data and computational skills for conducting
efficient, open, and reproducible research."
