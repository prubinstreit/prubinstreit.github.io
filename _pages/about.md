I am an advanced data science expert with a passion for analysis to make a positive impact 
on people, processes, and profits. Dedicated to providing collaborative leadership, 
unrelenting curiosity, and data-informed strategies necessary to create the conditions for success.
#Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the
#[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/) 
#and [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at
#[Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I am also an
#affiliated researcher with the
#[Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org) lab. I specialize
#in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in
#Political Science from the
#[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and my
#B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/).
#
#My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
#*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,

#among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
#consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
#latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
#focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
#including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
#institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
