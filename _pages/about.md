I am an advanced data science expert with a strong commitment to leveraging analysis to positively impact people, processes, and profits. My journey has taken me through diverse roles and industries, where I have consistently demonstrated my ability to provide collaborative leadership, unrelenting curiosity, and data-informed strategies essential for success. My academic foundation includes a PhD ABD and MS in Applied Economics from Northeastern University, an MS in Mathematical Finance from Boston University, and a BS in Mathematics with a Minor in Business Administration from the University of Florida. My technical proficiency encompasses a wide range of tools, including Python, SQL, R, Stata, Git, MATLAB, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Tableau, Hadoop, and Excel.

Throughout my career, I have held significant roles that allowed me to hone my expertise and drive impactful results. As a Senior Data Scientist at Aetna, a CVS Health Company, I led maternity-related campaign measurement efforts and turned underperforming campaigns into profit generators through causal inference. My tenure as Chair of the Mathematics Department at Mount Ida College saw me lead a team of professors, revamping the business mathematics curriculum for online management and access. Additionally, as Chief Data Officer at Success Schools, I co-founded a startup to provide turnkey operations for challenging student populations, overseeing IT infrastructure and financial operations while boosting revenue by 150% year-over-year.

In my role as Vice President of Analytics at eLayaway, I established an advanced analytics function, built the company's analytical engine, and performed advanced customer analysis to enhance marketing effectiveness. My efforts led to a 7% increase in angel investment capital within a year. I pride myself on remaining agile, fostering innovation, and cultivating collaborative team environments. My career is driven by a passion for uncovering causal processes and using data to create meaningful change, whether through enhancing educational systems, optimizing business strategies, or improving health outcomes.
